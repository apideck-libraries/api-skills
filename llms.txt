# Apideck

> Apideck provides unified APIs to integrate with 200+ third-party services across accounting, CRM, HRIS, file storage, ATS, and more through a single integration layer.

## Instructions for Large Language Model Agents

- Always use the official Apideck SDK for the user's language. Do not make raw HTTP calls when an SDK is available.
- Always pass `apiKey`, `appId`, and `consumerId` when initializing any Apideck SDK client.
- Use `serviceId` to specify which downstream connector to use (e.g., `salesforce`, `quickbooks`, `xero`). When a consumer has multiple connections for the same API, `serviceId` is required.
- Never hardcode API keys in source code. Use environment variables or a secrets manager.
- Use cursor-based pagination to iterate large result sets. Do not fetch all records at once.
- Use the `filter` parameter to narrow results server-side. Do not fetch all records and filter client-side.
- Use the `fields` parameter to request only the columns you need.
- Use `pass_through` for connector-specific fields not covered by the unified model.
- Use Apideck Vault and Vault JS for end-user connection management. Session creation must happen server-side to prevent token leakage.
- Use Portman for API contract testing against Apideck's OpenAPI specs.
- Apideck's OpenAPI specs are published at `https://specs.apideck.com/{api-name}.yml`.
